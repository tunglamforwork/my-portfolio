# 🐍 Python in Practice — Tips, Tools & Techniques for Everyday Development

Over the years, Python has become my go-to for quick automation, AI experiments, and building production-ready microservices.
Here’s what I’ve learned along the way.

---

## 🛠 My Python Use Cases

- CLI tools for data migration
- AI/ML prototypes with OpenAI, LangChain, and HuggingFace
- Web APIs with FastAPI and Flask
- Data transformation scripts for ETL pipelines

---

## 📌 Tips That Made a Difference

1. **Type Hints Are Worth It** — They make your code self-documenting and improve IDE assistance.
2. **Know Your Standard Library** — `collections.Counter`, `itertools.product`, and `functools.lru_cache` are lifesavers.
3. **Environment Management** — Use `pyenv` + `pipenv` or `poetry` to avoid dependency hell.
4. **Profile Before Optimizing** — `cProfile` and `timeit` reveal the real bottlenecks.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Python isn’t slow if you use the right data structures and algorithms.
- Readability > clever one-liners.
- Test early — pytest’s fixtures make integration tests painless.

## 💡 Next Steps

I’ll be sharing deep dives on:

- Python for AI pipeline automation
- Building production-ready FastAPI services
- Lesser-known standard library gems
