# 🚀 Projects & Lessons Learned

Over the course of my career as a **full-stack software engineer**, I’ve worked on projects that combine **modern web development** with **AI**, **real-time systems**, and **data-driven decision-making**.
Here’s a closer look at some of them — what I built, how I built it, and what I learned.

## 🧠 Udeffy – AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platform

**Goal:** Help learners master skills faster through adaptive learning paths.

**What I Built:**

- Backend in **NestJS** with a clean modular architecture
- AI lesson generation pipeline with **credit-based access control**
- Background processing with **BullMQ** and job event streaming via **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
- Frontend in **Next.js** with rich UI using **Tailwind CSS** + **Shadcn UI**

**Key Challenges & Solutions:**

- **Challenge:** Generating diverse lesson formats (article, video, quiz, assignments) without blocking the main thread.
  **Solution:** Offloaded generation to BullMQ jobs and used event streaming for live updates.
- **Challenge:** Personalizing learning without overwhelming users.
  **Solution:** Used survey-based pre-tests to tailor learning content dynamically.

**Outcome:** A scalable platform that can handle multiple concurrent learners with individualized AI-driven content.

## 🏡 LinkAI – AI for Smarter Real Estate Decisions

**Goal:** Provide actionable insights for property buyers, investors, and agents.

**What I Built:**

- Property valuation and trend analysis engine
- Integration with real-time market data APIs
- Custom **Copilot-style buyer agent** powered by prompt engineering
- Output guidance per focus key (e.g., price, schools, crime) for relevant sections

**Key Challenges & Solutions:**

- **Challenge:** Providing accurate insights from volatile market data.
  **Solution:** Combined API data with AI summarization and strict business logic rules to ensure reliability.
- **Challenge:** Keeping AI answers on-topic.
  **Solution:** Designed structured prompts with guardrails to avoid hallucinations.

**Outcome:** An intelligent assistant that produces market insights users can trust.

## 📍 AI-Powered Map Discovery Tool

**Goal:** Help users find places that match specific personal preferences.

**What I Built:**

- Map-based search with conversational AI interface
- Criteria filtering (e.g., “restaurants with a sunset view and vegan options”)
- Favorites system for saving places
- Next.js frontend with real-time map rendering

**Key Challenges & Solutions:**

- **Challenge:** Translating vague user requests into actionable map queries.
  **Solution:** Used AI to parse natural language into structured location search criteria.

**Outcome:** A conversational location search that feels like talking to a local expert.

## 🔌 AI-Assisted Wiring Diagram Tool

**Goal:** Speed up wiring diagram creation for engineers and designers.

**What I Built:**

- AI layout optimization for spacing and alignment of components
- Assisted drag-and-drop UI for quick design
- Export options for various industry-standard formats

**Key Challenges & Solutions:**

- **Challenge:** Maintaining precision in AI-generated layouts.
  **Solution:** Implemented constraint-based algorithms that respect design rules.

**Outcome:** Reduced manual layout time significantly for technical teams.

## 📚 Lessons Learned Across Projects

1. **AI is only as good as the workflow around it** — guardrails and validation are critical.
2. **Real-time features need strong architecture** — event-driven systems scale better than polling.
3. **User experience is king** — even the smartest AI fails if the UI is clunky.
4. **Scalable patterns matter** — modular NestJS architecture + Next.js SSR is a winning combo.
