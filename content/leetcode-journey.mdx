# ðŸ§© Leveling Up with LeetCode â€” My Approach to Algorithm Mastery

LeetCode isnâ€™t just for interview prep â€” itâ€™s a consistent way to improve problem-solving speed and algorithmic intuition.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ My LeetCode Strategy

1. **Daily Practice** â€” 1â€“2 problems covering easy, medium, and hard.
2. **Pattern Recognition** â€” focus on problem families like sliding window, binary search, and union-find.
3. **Explain It** â€” if I canâ€™t explain a solution in plain English, I donâ€™t understand it.

## ðŸ›  Tools That Help

- **LeetCode Discuss** â€” great for learning alternative approaches.
- **Python for Concise Solutions** â€” list comprehensions and built-in functions save time.
- **VSCode LeetCode Extension** â€” solve without switching contexts.

## ðŸ“Œ Lessons Learned

- Brute force is fine â€” as a starting point.
- Space complexity matters as much as time complexity.
- Rewriting a problem after solving it helps solidify understanding.
