# 🏛 Thinking in Architecture — Designing Scalable, Maintainable Systems

Architecture isn’t just for large enterprises — even small apps benefit from good structure.
Here’s my approach.

---

## 📐 Patterns I Rely On

- **Clean Architecture** — separates business rules from infrastructure.
- **Event-Driven Design** — use message queues (BullMQ, RabbitMQ) for scalability.
- **CQRS + Event Sourcing** — when auditing and history tracking are essential.
- **API Gateway** — unify and secure access to microservices.

---

## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **Modular Monolith First** — split into services only when necessary.
2. **APIs as Contracts** — design them for other teams, not just your own.
3. **Observability Is Part of Architecture** — logs, metrics, and tracing are non-negotiable.

## ⚡ Lessons Learned

- Premature microservices = unnecessary complexity.
- Event-driven systems scale better for real-time use cases.
- Documenting architecture is as important as designing it.
